      <h3>Background of Book Bans</h3>
      <p>
        Book bans are an issue that is slowly rising each year. The American
        Library Association reported that since tracking began in 1990, 2024 had
        the third highest number of book challenges. Book bans affect everyone,
        from public schools to libraries. In just the 2023-2024 school year,
        there were more than 10,000 book bans across the US- as found by PEN
        America. Pressure groups and government entities- groups that include
        elected officials, board members, and administrators- were shown to have
        initiated around 72% of the demand to censor books in both schools and
        public libraries. The number of documented attempts for book censorship
        has continued to grow and exceed numbers prior to 2020.

      <h3>Main Issues Book Bans Face</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt class="main-issue-sub">Underreporting</dt>
        <dd>
          This issue has risen due to the lack of public reporting or press
          coverage concerning the topic of book bans and censorship. For many,
          reporting on this topic can pose a risk for both the livelihood and
          personal safety of anyone involved.
        </dd>
        <dt class="main-issue-sub">Censorship by Exlusion</dt>
        <dd>
          When library workers or anyone involved in providing public access
          books are prohibited from purchasing books or required to place these
          books in restricted or less-accessible areas, censorship by exclusion
          occurs. This is usually due to fear of controversy or backlash.
        </dd>
        <dt class="main-issue-sub">Legislative Restrictions</dt>
        <dd>
          This occurs when states pass laws restricting what materials can be
          available in libraries, schools, and public areas based on the ideas
          or topic matter of said materials. Legislative restrictions have the
          most effect on schools, where they require school districts to
          restrict or remove any library material that is deemed to include
          “sexual content” or controversial themes, though this denotation is
          often broad and can sometimes be claimed falsely. Books that have been
          removed surround topic matter such as LGBTQ+
          characters/representation, race or racism, equity, social justice, and
          literary or educational merit.
